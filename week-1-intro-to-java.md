**Static typing:** 

* Once defined, you can't change the type of the variable.
* Everything has a type, you need to declare the type for variables, parameters and functions!

**Functions:**

* Functions\(methods\) need to belong to some class.

**Style Guide:**

* Class methods: static, actions taken by class itself.
* Instance methods: non-static, actions taken only by specific instances of some class.

**Class:** 

* Class has its own variables, also known as instance variables or non-static variables. These must be declared inside the class.

**Constructor:**

* Initialize an instance of the class \(similar with \_\_init\_\_ in python\).
* We can implement a copy constructor to make a copy, kind of like deep-copy in python.

# Study CS61B

**Goal:** Get better understanding of data structures‌

**Motivation:** The key for a good program is to know how to combine different data structures and use them for better efficiency. Mechanically memorizing some code snippets won't help you on writing good code and would overwhelm you with the huge amount of messy information.‌

**Arrangement:** The order of this diary would follow the syllabus of CS61B, from week1 to week14, though my actual study schedule might not be exactly the same as that.[
